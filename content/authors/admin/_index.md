  - title: Customer Segmentation Analysis – Olist E-Commerce
    date: '2025-06-01'
    date_end: '2025-07-01'
    summary: |-
      To help a SaaS-based e-commerce platform optimize revenue, I was tasked with segmenting over 2,900 active sellers to identify behavior patterns. I applied LRFM modeling and KMeans clustering on seller transaction and activity data, then created interactive dashboards to visualize insights. Based on the analysis, I identified four distinct seller segments and proposed tailored subscription plans and marketing strategies. These recommendations projected a potential 38% increase in revenue and R$105K in additional monthly gains.

    summary: |2-
      Faced with a high churn rate in a competitive e-commerce environment, I developed a machine learning model to identify at-risk customers using demographic, transaction, and interaction data. My role involved preparing the data, training classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and tuning them based on F2-score to reduce false negatives. As a result, the model reduced potential churn-related losses by over 70%, and the insights were deployed through a Streamlit dashboard to guide data-driven retention strategies.

    summary: |2-
      A retail supermarket was looking to improve customer retention and optimize promotional efforts. I was responsible for analyzing customer transaction data to uncover behavioral patterns and segment the customer base. I conducted LRFM modeling and performed statistical analysis to identify key shopping trends and group customers by value and frequency. Based on the findings, I delivered targeted recommendations including loyalty programs, premium product bundling, and reactivation strategies for low-frequency buyers, supporting more data-driven marketing decisions.

    summary: |2-
      I published a research paper titled *"AI-Generated Text Detector for English Written Essay using Ensemble RoBERTa"*, addressing the challenges posed by the rise of LLMs in education. To support academic integrity, I developed an ensemble model of three RoBERTa variants to distinguish between AI-generated and human-written essays. The model achieved a high F1-score of 98.692%, outperforming traditional algorithms and individual models, and was presented at the 2025 ICADEIS conference.

      A business aimed to boost engagement on its social media channels but lacked clarity on what content strategies worked best. I was assigned to analyze post data to identify patterns in user interaction. I explored engagement trends across different content types, posting times, and user behaviors using Python, and visualized the insights with Tableau. Based on the analysis, I proposed optimal posting schedules and call-to-action (CTA) strategies, which were used to refine content planning and improve overall engagement.

    summary: |2-
      To streamline hotel operations and user interaction, I developed a Hotel Management System that allows admins and visitors to manage hotel data and bookings. As the developer, I designed and implemented features such as hotel listings, filtering by price, location, and star rating, as well as room booking with voucher-based discounts. The system supports admin-level actions like adding, editing, and deleting hotel data, while enabling users to search, book rooms, and apply promo codes. This project enhanced my understanding of CRUD operations, user role access, and modular system design in Python.

I am a fresh graduate in Informatics from Telkom University with a strong interest in data analysis and machine learning. I enjoy turning complex data into meaningful insights to support business decisions. Through academic projects and independent learning, I have applied machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems such as customer churn prediction, seller segmentation, and AI text detection.
